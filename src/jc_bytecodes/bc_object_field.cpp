 *
 * Stack:

 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The objectref, which must be of type reference, is popped from the
 *   operand stack. The unsigned index is used as an index into the constant
 *   pool of the current package (§3.5 Frames). The constant pool item at
 *   the index must be of type CONSTANT_InstanceFieldref (§6.8.2
 *   CONSTANT_InstanceFieldref, CONSTANT_VirtualMethodref, and
 *   CONSTANT_SuperMethodref), a reference to a class and a field token.
 *
 *   The class of objectref must not be an array. If the field is protected,
 *   and it is a member of a superclass of the current class, and the field
 *   is not declared in the same package as the current class, then the
 *   class of objectref must be either the current class or a subclass of
 *   the current class.
 *
 *   The width of a field in a class instance is determined by the field
 *   type specified in the instruction. The item is resolved, determining
 *   the field offset 17 . The value at that offset into the class instance
 *   referenced by objectref is fetched. If the value is of type byte or
 *   type boolean, it is sign-extended to a short. The value is pushed onto
 *   the operand stack.
 *
 * Runtime Exception:
 *
 *   If objectref is null, the getfield_a instruction throws a
 *   NullPointerException.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   In some circumstances, the getfield_a instruction may throw a
 *   SecurityException if the current context (§3.4 Contexts) is not the
 *   owning context (§3.4 Contexts) of the object referenced by objectref.
 *   The exact circumstances when the exception will be thrown are specified
