 *
 * Stack:

 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The count must be of type short. It is popped off the operand stack.
 *   The count represents the number of elements in the array to be created.
 *   The unsigned byte atype is a code that indicates the type of array to
 *   create. It must take one of the following values:
 *
 *   +------------+-------+
 *   | Array Type | atype |
 *   +------------+-------+
 *   | T_BOOLEAN  |    10 |
 *   | T_BYTE     |    11 |
 *   | T_SHORT    |    12 |
 *   | T_INT      |    13 |
 *   +------------+-------+
 *
 *   A new array whose components are of type atype, of length count, is
 *   allocated from the heap. A reference arrayref to this new array object
 *   is pushed onto the operand stack. All of the elements of the new array
 *   are initialized to the default initial value for its type.
 *
 * Runtime Exception:
 *
 *   If count is less than zero, the newarray instruction throws a
 *   NegativeArraySizeException.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   If a virtual machine does not support the int data type, the value of
 *   atype may not be 13 (array type = T_INT).

 * Format:
 *   aastore
 *
 * Forms:
 *   aastore = 55 (0x37)
 *
 * Stack:
 *   ..., arrayref, index, value -> ...
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The arrayref must be of type reference and must refer to an array whose
 *   components are of type reference. The index must be of type short and
 *   the value must be of type reference. The arrayref, index and value are
 *   popped from the operand stack. The reference value is stored as the
 *   component of the array at index.
 *
 *   If the array referenced by arrayref is integrity-sensitive, its
 *   integrity is checked before the value is stored. The integrity control
 *   element is updated when the value is stored. The whole operation (value
 *   storage and the integrity control element update) is performed
 *   atomically.
 *
 *   At runtime the type of value must be confirmed to be assignment
 *   compatible with the type of the components of the array referenced by
 *   arrayref. Assignment of a value of reference type S (source) to a
 *   variable of reference type T (target) is allowed only when the type S
 *   supports all of the operations defined on type T. The detailed rules
 *   follow:
 *
 *   - If S is a class type, then:
 *       + If T is a class type, then S must be the same class as T, or
 *         S must be a subclass of T;
 *       + If T is an interface type, then S must implement interface T.
 *   - If S is an interface type[13], then:
 *       + If T is a class type, then T must be Object (§2.2.1.4
 *         Unsupported Classes);
 *       + If T is an interface type, T must be the same interface as S
 *         or a superinterface of S.
 *   - If S is an array type, namely the type SC[], that is, an array of
 *     components of type SC, then:
 *       + If T is a class type, then T must be Object.
 *       + If T is an array type, namely the type TC[], an array of
 *         components of type TC, then one of the following must be true:
 *           * TC and SC are the same primitive type (§3.1 Data Types and
 *             Values).
 *           * TC and SC are reference types[14] (§3.1 Data Types and Values)
 *             with type SC assignable to TC, by these rules.
 *       + If T is an interface type, T must be one of the interfaces
 *         implemented by arrays.
 *
 *   13: When both S and T are arrays of reference types, this algorithm is
 *   applied recursively using the types of the arrays, namely SC and TC. In
 *   the recursive call, S, which was SC in the original call, may be an
 *   interface type. This rule can only be reached in this manner.
 *   Similarly, in the recursive call, T, which was TC in the original call,
 *   may be an interface type.
 *
 *   14: This version of the Java Card virtual machine does not support
 *   multi-dimensional arrays. Therefore, neither SC or TC can be an array
 *   type.
 *
 * Runtime Exceptions:
 *
 *   If arrayref is null, aastore throws a NullPointerException.
 *
 *   Otherwise, if index is not within the bounds of the array referenced by
 *   arrayref, the aastore instruction throws an
 *   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
 *
 *   Otherwise, if arrayref is not null and the actual type of value is not
 *   assignment compatible with the actual type of the component of the
 *   array, aastore throws an ArrayStoreException.
 *
 *   Otherwise if the array referenced by arrayref is integrity-sensitive
 *   and an inconsistency is detected during the array integrity check, the
 *   aastore instruction throws a SecurityException.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   In some circumstances, the aastore instruction may throw a
 *   SecurityException if the current context (§3.4 Contexts) is not the
 *   owning context (§3.4 Contexts) of the array referenced by arrayref. The
 *   exact circumstances when the exception will be thrown are specified in
 *   Chapter 6 of the Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card 3
 *   Platform, v3.0.5, Classic Edition.
